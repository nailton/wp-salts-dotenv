# WordPress Generate Salts style PHP dotenv

A simple plugin for generating WordPress salt keys, with style [PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)  in [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com/3).

## Installation
* Install with Will Bond's [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
* Install with Git
    1. `cd Packages`
    2. `git clone https://github.com/nailton/wp-salts-dotenv.git "wp-salts-dotenv"`
    3. Use the Sublime Text command pallete or `ctrl+alt+d`

## Motivation
If you are using security settings as in this example: https://dotdev.co/tutorials/secure-wordpress-config-dotenv/, you provalvelmente will not generate the secret of wordpress keys in hand again and again in Their projects and different environments: local, build and production.
I've used the https://github.com/tatemz/WordPress-Generate-Salts.
